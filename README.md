# Primes Experiments

Hey. So this looks kinda bleak, but everything's in a different branch.  

we've got:  
`singleCore` which is (obviously) single cored,  
`multithreaded` which is (also obviously) multithreaded cored, and  
`cudaGPU` which is written in c++ rather than c, and uses cuda for hardware acceleration

Have a look at one of them for more instructions, Good luck.
