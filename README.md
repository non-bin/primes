# Primes Experiments

Hey. So this looks kinda bleak, but everything's in a different branch.  

we've got:  
`singleCore` which is (obviously) single cored,  
`multithreaded` which is (also obviously) multithreaded cored, and  
`cudaGPU` which is written in c++ rather than c, and uses cuda for hardware acceleration  
  
So switch to one of them for more instructions. Good luck.
