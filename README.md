# Primes Cuda Accelerated

# THIS DOESN'T WORK YET

## Usage

This one's a little harder, but not really. You will need a cuda enabled gpu (google it), the `cuda` framework, and the `nvidia-cuda-toolkit`.  
Once you have them you can run `./run.sh`, and play with the config variables on lines 10-20 ish
